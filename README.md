# Wordle Clone
This repository contains a simple Wordle clone web app built with Javascript.

## Features:

+ 5-letter word guessing game
+ Color-coded feedback for each guess
+ Word list customizable from an external file

## Getting Started:

- Clone the repository.
- Open wordlehome.html in your local browser (with a live server extension.)

+ Enter a 5-letter word guess.
+ Press Enter to submit your guess.

The letters will be colored based on their presence and position in the target word:

Green: The letter is in the correct position.

Yellow: The letter is in the word but in a different position.

Red: The letter is not in the word at all.

*You have 6 attempts to guess the word correctly.*

## Customization:

The words5.txt file contains the list of valid words used for guessing. You can replace this file with your own list of words.

## Contributing:

This clone was created in collaboration with partner Eddie P and mentor Sebastian Felling.

Pull requests and suggestions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and make your own changes.

## Additional Notes:

This is a basic implementation of Wordle and can be further enhanced with features like word suggestions, difficulty levels, and themes.
